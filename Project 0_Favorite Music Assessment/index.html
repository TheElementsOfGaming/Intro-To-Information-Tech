    <h2>Quarter Past Midnight Lyrics</h2>

    <div class="lyrics">
        [Verse 1]
        <br>
        It's a quarter past midnight
        <br>
        As we cut through the city
        <br>
        Yeah, yeah, yeah, the streets are getting restless
        <br>
        Good times bad decisions
        <br>
        Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a quarter past midnight
        <br>
        And the sirens are mending some hearts
        <br>
        But we're the losers on the back seats
        <br>
        Singing "Love Will Tear Us Apart"
        <br>
        It's a quarter past midnight
        <br>
        Still avoiding tomorrow
        <br>
        It's a quarter past midnight
        <br>
        But we're just getting going
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        [Chorus]
        <br>
        We keep on running
        <br>
        Running through a red light
        <br>
        Like we're trying to burn the night away
        <br>
        Away-way, oh, away-way, oh
        <br>
        <br>
        [Post-Chorus]
        <br>
        This is my favorite part oh
        <br>
        Help me piece it all together darling
        <br>
        Before it falls apart oh
        <br>
        Help me piece it all together
        <br>
        <br>
        [Verse 2]
        <br>
        It's a quarter past midnight
        <br>
        And the speakers are blowing
        <br>
        Yeah, yeah, We want the bodies on the billboards
        <br>
        Not the lives underneath them
        <br>
        Yeah, yeah, yeah, and now we're crawling up the walls again
        <br>
        And it's a quarter past twelve
        <br>
        And you said we'd leave this place in dust
        <br>
        And fall from heaven straight through hell
        <br>
        We never know what we have
        <br>
        We never knew what we had
        <br>
        <br>
        [Chorus]
        <br>
        We keep on running
        <br>
        Running through a red light
        <br>
        Like we're trying to burn the night away
        <br>
        Away-way, oh, away-way, oh
        <br>
        Why are we always chasing after something
        <br>
        Like we're trying to throw our lives away?
        <br>
        Away-way, oh, away-way, oh
        <br>
        <br>
        [Post-Chorus]
        <br>
        This is my favorite part oh
        <br>
        Help me piece it all together darling
        <br>
        Before it falls apart oh
        <br>
        Help me piece it all together
        <br>
        <br>
        [Bridge]
        <br>
        (I can't remember, I can't remember
        <br>
        I can't remember, I can't remember)
        <br>
        It's a quarter past midnight
        <br>
        And the secrets are flowing
        <br>
        Our lips are getting looser
        <br>
        I don't know what I'm saying
        <br>
        We never knew what we had
        <br>
        I never know what I've had
        <br>
        <br>
        [Chorus]
        <br>
        We keep on running
        <br>
        Running through a red light
        <br>
        Like we're trying to burn the night away
        <br>
        Away-way, oh, away-way, oh
        <br>
        Why are we always chasing after something
        <br>
        Like we trying to throw our lives away?
        <br>
        Away-way, oh, away-way, oh
        <br>
        <br>
        [Post-Chorus]
        <br>
        This is my favorite part so
        <br>
        Help me piece it all together darling
        <br>
        Before it falls apart
        <br>
        Help me piece it all together
